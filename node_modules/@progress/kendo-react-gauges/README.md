## React ArcGauge Component

[The KendoReact ArcGauge component](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/gauges/arcgauge/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-gauges) is perfect for representing value ranges across a sleek looking arc. This React component features the ability to define a minimum and maximum angle, letting arcs range from 0 to 360 degrees, and the current value will be displayed within the arc itself as well as a template in the middle of the component.

## React CircularGauge Component

[The KendoReact Circular Gauge component](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/gauges/circulargauge/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-gauges) is a data visualization component that represents a value within a full-circle arc. This eye-catching React component is compact, simple to bind to data sources and provides a broad set of configuration options to ensure a natural fit in any React application.

## React LinearGauge Component

[The KendoReact LinearGauge component](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/gauges/lineargauge/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-gauges) represents values on a linear scale, providing not just a bar to showcase current value but also a scale of tick and labels to help showcase what the value represents. The React LinearGauge can be rendered in both horizontal and vertical modes.

## React RadialGauge Component

[The KendoReact RadialGauge component](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/gauges/radialgauge/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-gauges) represents values on a circular arc with a centralized pointer to indicate the current value. The gauge can animate the pointer to various values, provides support for multiple pointers and allows for deep customization with the out-of-the-box configuration options.
